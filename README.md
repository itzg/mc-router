## Docker Multi-Architecture Image

The [multi-architecture image published at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/itzg/mc-router) supports amd64, arm64, and arm32v6 (i.e. RaspberryPi).

## Docker Compose Usage

The diagram below shows how this `docker-compose.yml` configures two Minecraft server services named `vanilla` and `forge`, which also become the internal network aliases. _Notice those services don't need their ports exposed since the internal networking allows for the inter-container access._

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  vanilla:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
  forge:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
      TYPE: FORGE
  router:
    image: ${MC_ROUTER_IMAGE:-itzg/mc-router}
    depends_on:
      - forge
      - vanilla
    environment:
      MAPPING: |
        vanilla.example.com=vanilla:25565
        forge.example.com=forge:25565
    ports:
      - "25565:25565"
```

The `router` service is only one of the services that needs to exposed on the external network. The `MAPPING` declares how the hostname users will enter into their Minecraft client will map to the internal services.

![](docs/compose-diagram.png)

To test out this example, add these two entries to my "hosts" file:

```
127.0.0.1 vanilla.example.com
127.0.0.1 forge.example.com
```

### Using Docker auto-discovery

When running `mc-router` in a Docker environment you can pass the `--in-docker` or `--in-docker-swarm` 
command-line argument and it will poll the Docker API periodically to find all the running
containers/services for Minecraft instances. To enable discovery you have to set the `mc-router.host`
label on the container. These are the labels scanned:

- `mc-router.host`: Used to configure the hostname the Minecraft clients would use to 
  connect to the server. The container/service endpoint will be used as the routed backend. You can 
  use more than one hostname by splitting it with a comma.
- `mc-router.port`: This value must be set to the port the Minecraft server is listening on.
  The default value is 25565.
- `mc-router.default`: Set this to a truthy value to make this server the default backend.
  Please note that `mc-router.host` is still required to be set.
- `mc-router.network`: Specify the network you are using for the router if multiple are 
  present in the container/service. You can either use the network ID, it's full name or an alias.

#### Example Docker deployment

Refer to [this example docker-compose.yml](docs/sd-docker.docker-compose.yml) to see how to
configure two different Minecraft servers and a `mc-router` instance for use with Docker service discovery.

#### Example Docker Swarm deployment

Refer to [this example docker-compose.yml](docs/swarm.docker-compose.yml) to see how to
configure two different Minecraft servers and a `mc-router` instance for use with Docker Swarm service discovery.

## Routing Configuration

The routing configuration allows routing via a config file rather than a command. 
You need to set `-routes-config` or `ROUTES_CONFIG` env variable.
The following shows a JSON file for routes config, where `default-server` can also be `null` or omitted:

```json
{
  "default-server": "vanilla:25565",
  "mappings": {
    "vanilla.example.com": "vanilla:25565",
    "forge.example.com": "forge:25565"
  }
}
```

Sending a SIGHUP signal will cause mc-router to reload the routes config from disk.

## Auto Scale Allow/Deny List

The allow/deny list configuration allows limiting which players can scale up servers when using the `-auto-scale-up` option (`AUTO_SCALE_UP` env variable) and which players can cancel an active down scaler when using the `-auto-scale-down` option (`AUTO_SCALE_DOWN` env variable). Global allow/deny lists can be configured that apply to all backend servers, but server-specific lists can be added as well. There are a few important things to note about the configuration:
- The `mc-router` process will not automatically pick up changes to the config. If updates to the config are made, the router must be restarted.
- Allowlists always take priority over denylists. This means if a player is included in a sever-specific allowlist and the global denylist, the player will still be considered allowed on that server. If a player is listed in both a global allowlist and denylist, the denylist entry will be ignored.
- Player entries only require a `uuid` or `name`. Both will be checked if specified, but otherwise a `uuid` will take priority over a `name`.

An example configuration might look something like:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "denylist": [
      {"uuid": "<some player's uuid>", "name": "<some player's name>"}
    ]
  },
  "servers": {
    "my.server.domain": {
      "allowlist": [
        {"uuid": "<some player's uuid>"}
      ]
    },
    "my.other-server.domain": {
      "denylist": [
        {"uuid": "<some player's uuid>"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the example, players in the `my.server.domain` allowlist will be able to scale up `my.server.domain`. Players in the global denylist and the `my.other-server.domain` denylist will **not** be able to scale up `my.other-server.domain`. Any servers not listed in the config will also be affected by the global allowlist. Note that if a global allowlist is specified, no denylists will have any effect as that global allowlist will affect all servers.

For more information on the allow/deny list configuration, see the [json schema](docs/allow-deny-list.schema.json).

## Kubernetes Usage

### Using Kubernetes Service auto-discovery

When running `mc-router` as a Kubernetes Pod and you pass the `--in-kube-cluster` command-line argument, then it will automatically watch for any services annotated with
- `mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName` : The value of the annotation will be registered as the external hostname Minecraft clients would used to connect to the routed service. The service is used as the routed backend. You can use more hostnames by splitting them with comma.
- `mc-router.itzg.me/defaultServer` : The service is used as the default if no other `externalServiceName` annotations applies.

For example, start `mc-router`'s container spec with

```yaml
image: itzg/mc-router
name: mc-router
args: ["--in-kube-cluster"]
```

and configure the backend minecraft server's service with the annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mc-forge
  annotations:
    "mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName": "external.host.name"
```

you can use multiple host names:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mc-forge
  annotations:
    "mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName": "external.host.name,other.host.name"
```

### Service parsing

To detrmine the endpoint mc-router will pick the host from `spec.clusterIP` by default, if the service is of type `ExtenalName` it will use `spec.externalName` instead.

For the port it will look in `spec.ports` for a port named `mc-router`, if not present `minecraft` or, if neither port names exist, it will use default minecraft port value 25565.

### Example Kubernetes deployment

[This example deployment](docs/k8s-example-auto.yaml)
* Declares an `mc-router` service that exposes a node port 25565
* Declares a service account with access to watch and list services
* Declares `--in-kube-cluster` in the `mc-router` container arguments
* Two "backend" Minecraft servers are declared each with an
  `"mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName"` annotation that declares their external server name(s)

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itzg/mc-router/master/docs/k8s-example-auto.yaml
```

![](docs/example-deployment-auto.drawio.png)

##### Notes
* This deployment assumes two persistent volume claims: `mc-stable` and `mc-snapshot`
* I extended the allowed node port range by adding `--service-node-port-range=25000-32767`
  to `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`

##### Auto Scale Up/Down

The `-auto-scale-up` flag argument makes the router "wake up" any stopped backend servers by changing `replicas: 0` to `replicas: 1`. The `-auto-scale-down` flag argument makes the router shut down any running backend servers with no active connections by changing `replicas: 1` to `replicas: 0`. The scale down will occur after a configurable (using the `-auto-scale-down-after` argument) waiting period, such as `10m` (10 minutes), `2h` (2 hours), etc. If any players connect to the server during this period the scale down will be canceled. It is recommended to set this value high enough so a temporary player disconnect will not immediately shut down the server (`1m` or higher).

Both options require using `kind: StatefulSet` instead of `kind: Service` for the Minecraft backend servers.

They also require the `ClusterRole` to permit `get` + `update` for `statefulsets` & `statefulsets/scale`,
e.g. like this (or some equivalent more fine-grained one to only watch/list services+statefulsets, and only get+update scale):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: services-watcher
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services"]
  verbs: ["watch","list"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["statefulsets", "statefulsets/scale"]
  verbs: ["watch","list","get","update"]
```

Make sure to set `StatefulSet.metadata.name` and `StatefulSet.spec.serviceName` to the same value;
otherwise, autoscaling will not trigger:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mc-forge
  annotations:
    "mc-router.itzg.me/defaultServer": "true"
    "mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName": "external.host.name"
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mc-forge
spec:
  serviceName: mc-forge
```

## REST API

* `GET /routes` (with `Accept: application/json`)

  Retrieves the currently configured routes

* `POST /routes` (with `Content-Type: application/json`)

  Registers a route given a JSON body structured like:
  ```json
  {
    "serverAddress": "CLIENT REQUESTED SERVER ADDRESS",
    "backend": "HOST:PORT"
  }
  ```

* `POST /defaultRoute` (with `Content-Type: application/json`)

  Registers a default route to the given backend. JSON body is structured as:
  ```json
  {
    "backend": "HOST:PORT"
  }
  ```

* `DELETE /routes/{serverAddress}`

  Deletes an existing route for the given `serverAddress`

## ngrok

mc-router has built-in support to run as an [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/). To enable this support, pass [an ngrok authtoken](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/#per-agent-authtokens) to the command-line argument or environment variable, [shown above](#usage).

### Ngrok Quick Start

Create/access an ngrok account and [allocate an agent authtoken from the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/authtokens).

In a new directory, create a file called `.env` with the allocated token

```dotenv
NGROK_TOKEN=...
```

In the same directory, create the following compose file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    environment:
      EULA: true
    volumes:
      - mc-data:/data
    # No port mapping since mc-router connects over compose network
  router:
    image: itzg/mc-router
    environment:
      DEFAULT: mc:25565
      NGROK_TOKEN: ${NGROK_TOKEN}
    # No port mapping needed since it routes through ngrok tunnel

volumes:
  mc-data: {}
```

Start the compose project:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Grab the mc-router logs using:

```shell
docker compose logs router
```

From those logs, locate the `ngrokUrl` parameter from the "Listening" info log message, such as `tcp://8.tcp.ngrok.io:99999`.

In the Minecraft client, the server address will be the part after the "tcp://" prefix, such as `8.tcp.ngrok.io:99999`.

## Webhook Support

Refer to [the usage section above](#usage) for `-webhook-*` argument descriptions.

### Sample connect event payloads

The following are sample payloads for the `connect` webhook events.

#### Successful player backend connection

```json
{
  "event": "connect",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-20T22:26:30.2568775-05:00",
  "status": "success",
  "client": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 56860
  },
  "server": "localhost",
  "player": {
    "name": "itzg",
    "uuid": "5cddfd26-fc86-4981-b52e-c42bb10bfdef"
  },
  "backend": "localhost:25566"
}
```

**NOTE** `client` refers to the machine where the Minecraft client is connecting from and is conveyed separately from the `player` starting a session. As seen below, the player information may not always be present, such as when the client is pinging the server list.

#### Successful server ping backend connection

**NOTE** the absence of `player` in this payload since the Minecraft client does not send player information in the server ping request.

```json
{
  "event": "connect",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-20T22:26:30.2568775-05:00",
  "status": "success",
  "client": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 56396
  },
  "server": "localhost",
  "backend": "localhost:25566"
}
```

#### Missing backend

In this the status is `"missing-backend"` since the requested server `invalid.example.com` does not have a configured/discovered backend entry.

```json
{
  "event": "connect",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-20T22:26:30.2568775-05:00",
  "status": "missing-backend",
  "client": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 56891
  },
  "server": "invalid.example.com",
  "player": {
    "name": "itzg",
    "uuid": "5cddfd26-fc86-4981-b52e-c42bb10bfdef"
  },
  "error": "No backend found"
}
```

#### Failed backend connection

In this case the `status` is `"failed-backend-connection"` indicating that a backend server was located but a connection could not be established from mc-router.

```json
{
  "event": "connect",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-20T22:26:30.2568775-05:00",
  "status": "failed-backend-connection",
  "client": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 56905
  },
  "server": "localhost",
  "player": {
    "name": "itzg",
    "uuid": "5cddfd26-fc86-4981-b52e-c42bb10bfdef"
  },
  "backend": "localhost:25566",
  "error": "dial tcp [::1]:25566: connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it."
}
```

## Development

### Building locally with Docker

```bash
docker build -t mc-router .
```

### Build locally without Docker

After [installing Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and doing a `go mod download` to install all required prerequisites, just like the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) does, you can:

```bash
make test # go test -v ./...
go build ./cmd/mc-router/
```

### Skaffold

For "in-cluster development" it's convenient to use https://skaffold.dev. Any changes to Go source code
will trigger a go build, new container image pushed to registry with a new tag, and refresh in Kubernetes
with the image tag used in the deployment transparently updated to the new tag and thus new pod created pulling new images,
as configured by [skaffold.yaml](skaffold.yaml):

    skaffold dev

When using Google Cloud (GCP), first create a _Docker Artifact Registry_,
then add the _Artifact Registry Reader_ Role to the _Compute Engine default service account_ of your _GKE `clusterService` Account_ (to avoid error like "container mc-router is waiting to start: ...-docker.pkg.dev/... can't be pulled"),
then use e.g. `gcloud auth configure-docker europe-docker.pkg.dev` or equivalent one time (to create a `~/.docker/config.json`),
and then use e.g. `--default-repo=europe-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR-PROJECT/YOUR-ARTIFACT-REGISTRY` option for `skaffold dev`.

### Performing snapshot release with Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ${PWD}:/build -w /build \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  goreleaser/goreleaser \
  release --snapshot --rm-dist
```
