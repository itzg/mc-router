## Docker Multi-Architecture Image

The [multi-architecture image published at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/itzg/mc-router) supports amd64, arm64, and arm32v6 (i.e. RaspberryPi).

## Docker Compose Usage

The diagram below shows how this `docker-compose.yml` configures two Minecraft server services named `vanilla` and `forge`, which also become the internal network aliases. _Notice those services don't need their ports exposed since the internal networking allows for the inter-container access._

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  vanilla:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
  forge:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
      TYPE: FORGE
  router:
    image: ${MC_ROUTER_IMAGE:-itzg/mc-router}
    depends_on:
      - forge
      - vanilla
    environment:
      MAPPING: |
        vanilla.example.com=vanilla:25565
        forge.example.com=forge:25565
    ports:
      - "25565:25565"
```

The `router` service is only one of the services that needs to exposed on the external network. The `MAPPING` declares how the hostname users will enter into their Minecraft client will map to the internal services.

![](docs/compose-diagram.png)

To test out this example, add these two entries to my "hosts" file:

```
127.0.0.1 vanilla.example.com
127.0.0.1 forge.example.com
```

## Routing Configuration

The routing configuration allows routing via a config file rather than a command. 
You need to set `-routes-config` or `ROUTES_CONFIG` env variable.
The following shows a JSON file for routes config, where `default-server` can also be `null` or omitted:

```json
{
  "default-server": "vanilla:25565",
  "mappings": {
    "vanilla.example.com": "vanilla:25565",
    "forge.example.com": "forge:25565"
  }
}
```

## Kubernetes Usage

### Using Kubernetes Service auto-discovery

When running `mc-router` as a Kubernetes Pod and you pass the `--in-kube-cluster` command-line argument, then it will automatically watch for any services annotated with
- `mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName` : The value of the annotation will be registered as the external hostname Minecraft clients would used to connect to the routed service. The service's clusterIP and target port are used as the routed backend. You can use more hostnames by splitting them with comma.
- `mc-router.itzg.me/defaultServer` : The service's clusterIP and target port are used as the default if no other `externalServiceName` annotations applies.

For example, start `mc-router`'s container spec with

```yaml
image: itzg/mc-router
name: mc-router
args: ["--in-kube-cluster"]
```

and configure the backend minecraft server's service with the annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mc-forge
  annotations:
    "mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName": "external.host.name"
```

you can use multiple host names:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mc-forge
  annotations:
    "mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName": "external.host.name,other.host.name"
```

mc-router will pick the service port named either `minecraft` or `mc-router`. If neither port names exist, it will use port value 25565.

### Example Kubernetes deployment

[This example deployment](docs/k8s-example-auto.yaml)
* Declares an `mc-router` service that exposes a node port 25565
* Declares a service account with access to watch and list services
* Declares `--in-kube-cluster` in the `mc-router` container arguments
* Two "backend" Minecraft servers are declared each with an
  `"mc-router.itzg.me/externalServerName"` annotation that declares their external server name(s)

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itzg/mc-router/master/docs/k8s-example-auto.yaml
```

![](docs/example-deployment-auto.drawio.png)

##### Notes
* This deployment assumes two persistent volume claims: `mc-stable` and `mc-snapshot`
* I extended the allowed node port range by adding `--service-node-port-range=25000-32767`
  to `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`

##### Auto Scale Up

The `-auto-scale-up` flag argument makes the router "wake up" any stopped backend servers, by changing `replicas: 0` to `replicas: 1`.

This requires using `kind: StatefulSet` instead of `kind: Service` for the Minecraft backend servers.

It also requires the `ClusterRole` to permit `get` + `update` for `statefulsets` & `statefulsets/scale`,
e.g. like this (or some equivalent more fine-grained one to only watch/list services+statefulsets, and only get+update scale):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: services-watcher
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services"]
  verbs: ["watch","list"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["statefulsets", "statefulsets/scale"]
  verbs: ["watch","list","get","update"]
```

## Docker Swarm Usage

### Using Docker Swarm Service auto-discovery

When running `mc-router` in a Docker Swarm environment you can pass the `--in-docker-swarm` 
command-line argument and it will poll the Docker API periodically to find all the running
services for minecraft instances. To enable discovery you have to set the `mc-router.host`
label on the service. These are the labels scanned:

- `mc-router.host`: Used to configure the hostname the Minecraft clients would use to 
  connect to the server. The service endpoint will be used as the routed backend. You can 
  use more than one hostname by splitting it with a comma.
- `mc-router.port`: This value must be set to the port the Minecraft server is listening on.
  The default value is 25565.
- `mc-router.default`: Set this to a truthy value to make this server the deafult backend.
  Please note that `mc-router.host` is still required to be set.
- `mc-router.network`: Specify the network you are using for the router if multiple are 
  present in the service. You can either use the network ID, it's full name or an alias.

### Example Docker Swarm deployment

Refer to [this example docker-compose.yml](docs/swarm.docker-compose.yml) to see how to
configure two different Minecraft servers and a `mc-router` instance. Notice how you don't 
have to expose the Minecraft instances ports, but all the containers are required to be in
the same network.

## REST API

* `GET /routes` (with `Accept: application/json`)

  Retrieves the currently configured routes

* `POST /routes` (with `Content-Type: application/json`)

  Registers a route given a JSON body structured like:
  ```json
  {
    "serverAddress": "CLIENT REQUESTED SERVER ADDRESS",
    "backend": "HOST:PORT"
  }
  ```

* `POST /defaultRoute` (with `Content-Type: application/json`)

  Registers a default route to the given backend. JSON body is structured as:
  ```json
  {
    "backend": "HOST:PORT"
  }
  ```

* `DELETE /routes/{serverAddress}`

  Deletes an existing route for the given `serverAddress`

## ngrok

mc-router has built-in support to run as an [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/). To enable this support, pass [an ngrok authtoken](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/#per-agent-authtokens) to the command-line argument or environment variable, [shown above](#usage).

### Ngrok Quick Start

Create/access an ngrok account and [allocate an agent authtoken from the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/authtokens).

In a new directory, create a file called `.env` with the allocated token

```dotenv
NGROK_TOKEN=...
```

In the same directory, create the following compose file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    environment:
      EULA: true
    volumes:
      - mc-data:/data
    # No port mapping since mc-router connects over compose network
  router:
    image: itzg/mc-router
    environment:
      DEFAULT: mc:25565
      NGROK_TOKEN: ${NGROK_TOKEN}
    # No port mapping needed since it routes through ngrok tunnel

volumes:
  mc-data: {}
```

Start the compose project:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Grab the mc-router logs using:

```shell
docker compose logs router
```

From those logs, locate the `ngrokUrl` parameter from the "Listening" info log message, such as `tcp://8.tcp.ngrok.io:99999`.

In the Minecraft client, the server address will be the part after the "tcp://" prefix, such as `8.tcp.ngrok.io:99999`.

## Development

### Building locally with Docker

```bash
docker build -t mc-router .
```

### Build locally without Docker

After [installing Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and doing a `go mod download` to install all required prerequisites, just like the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) does, you can:

```bash
make test # go test -v ./...
go build ./cmd/mc-router/
```

### Skaffold

For "in-cluster development" it's convenient to use https://skaffold.dev. Any changes to Go source code
will trigger a go build, new container image pushed to registry with a new tag, and refresh in Kubernetes
with the image tag used in the deployment transparently updated to the new tag and thus new pod created pulling new images,
as configured by [skaffold.yaml](skaffold.yaml):

    skaffold dev

When using Google Cloud (GCP), first create a _Docker Artifact Registry_,
then add the _Artifact Registry Reader_ Role to the _Compute Engine default service account_ of your _GKE `clusterService` Account_ (to avoid error like "container mc-router is waiting to start: ...-docker.pkg.dev/... can't be pulled"),
then use e.g. `gcloud auth configure-docker europe-docker.pkg.dev` or equivalent one time (to create a `~/.docker/config.json`),
and then use e.g. `--default-repo=europe-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR-PROJECT/YOUR-ARTIFACT-REGISTRY` option for `skaffold dev`.

### Performing snapshot release with Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ${PWD}:/build -w /build \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  goreleaser/goreleaser \
  release --snapshot --rm-dist
```
